# QR-Code-Generator
The QR code generator lets you generate QR for vehicles residing in residential complexes or office spaces based on inputs from user including, Name, Flat number, Block number, Vehicle Number, Vehicle Model

This QR code generator was a part of my internship project which included developing a way to cater the issue of huge residential societies, Ofiice compleces where it is difficut to keep a track of vehicles incoming and outgoing.
Without the record for the vehicles, this leaves a scope for guest vehicles to enter such complexes which can give rise to some criminal actions.
So a customised Qr code for each vehicle will help the security or the guard on duty to recognize the vehicle using a scanner

A somewhat simillar process that happens at toll tax where the barricade opens when the payment is done through the Tag or code sticked to the vehicle
